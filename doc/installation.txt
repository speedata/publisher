How to install the speedata Publisher (ZIP file)
================================================

See also the online-instructions at https://doc.speedata.de/publisher/en/description-en/installation.html (EN) or https://doc.speedata.de/publisher/de/installation/ (DE)

The ZIP file is organized as follows:

speedata-publisher/
├── bin
├── share
└── sw


you can run the publisher without further installation just by calling the
program named 'sp' in the `bin' directory from the command line.

The shell's current directory should be the directory with the data and layout
file.

To avoid giving the path to the sp binary every time the publisher is called,
you should add the location of the binary to the PATH environment variable.



Optional: add bin directory to the PATH environment variable
=============================================================

Non-permanent
-------------

{{ if or (eq .Os "linux") (eq .Os "darwin")  }}
Run this on the command line:

     cd speedata-publisher/bin
     export PATH=$PATH:$PWD
{{ end }}{{ if eq .Os "windows"  }}
Run these commands on the command prompt

    cd speedata-publisher\bin
    set PATH=%PATH%;%CD%
{{ end }}

Permanent
---------
{{ if eq .Os "linux"  }}
Edit the startup file for your system. This depends heavily on your
shell/distribution. Usually it is something like .bashrc or .bash_profile in
your home directory or /etc/profile for a system wide installation. Add a line
like this:

    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/installation

{{ end }}{{ if eq .Os "darwin"  }}
For a global installation: add a file in /etc/paths.d with one line
(the path do the bin directory):

    cd speedata-publisher/bin
    echo $PWD | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/speedata

For a local installation:

Edit the startup file for your system. This depends heavily on your
shell/distribution. Usually it is something like .bashrc or .bash_profile in
your home directory. Add a line like this:

    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/installation


{{ end }}{{ if eq .Os "windows"  }}
