= How to configure the speedata publisher

The speedata publisher can be configured in several ways:

. The file publisher.cfg in /etc/speedata/, in the home directory (with a leading dot) and in the current working directory (Linux, Mac)
. The file %APPDATA%\speedata\publisher.cfg on Windows.
. Parameters given on the command line
. Options given in the layout file

== The file `publisher.cfg`

The file publisher.cfg (/etc/speedata/publisher.cfg, $HOME/.publisher.cfg and in the current working directory) is a text file, that is read at the beginning of the publisher run. The default file looks like this:

------------------------------
data      = data.xml
layout    = layout.xml
autoopen  = false
# This is a comment
# And this is not a comment
# ^^^ of course the line above is also a comment
#

# section specific values
[section]
key = value
------------------------------

You can access the base directory of the project with `%(projectdir)s`. This is the directory with the file `publisher.cfg`.

All entries in the configuration file are optional.
The configuration files are read in the following order: `/etc/speedata/publisher.cfg`, `~/.publisher.cfg` and in the current directory `publisher.cfg`.
The current directory can be changed on the command line with the switch `--wd=....`.


The format of the file is important, otherwise it won’t be recognized. The following options are supported:

`autoopen`::
   if true, the publisher opens the PDF file. Default: false. The same effect can be achieved if you run sp --autoopen.
`cache`::
   Caching-strategy for http(s) image requests and external image processors. Use `fast` for file system lookup only or `optimal` for checking on each request. Use `none` for no caching.
`data`::
   Name of the data file (XML). If not given, the system uses `data.xml`.
`dummy`::
   If true, the system won’t read the data file, instead it uses the single element `<data />` as its input.
`extra-dir`::
   A list of directories in the file system separated by `;` (Windows) or `:` (Mac, Linux). These directories contain the images, fonts, source files and other assets that are used during the publisher run. Example for windows: `extra-dir=c:\myfonts`.
`extensionhandler`::
   Assignment of file extensions to converters defined in 'imagehandler'. To convert graphics on-the-fly. Example: `extensionhandler="mmd:mermaid"`. Multiple entries are separated by semicolon. See also `imagehandler`. (Since version 3.9.1.)
`extraxml`::
   Add this XML file to the layout instructions. List of comma separated file names (`extraxml=file1.xml,file2.xml`).
`fontloader`::
   Set the fontloader to `fontforge` (default until version 4) or `harfbuzz` (default starting from version 5).
`filter`::
   Run the given file as an Lua-Filter. See the section <<ch-preprocessing>>.
`fontpath`::
   Set the path for system fonts. On Windows this is `%WINDIR%\Fonts`, on Mac OS X it defaults to `/Library/Fonts:/System/Library/Fonts`.
`grid`::
   If true, the underlying grid is shown in the PDF file. For debugging purpose only.
`imagecache`::
   Folder for cached images (`href="http://..."` and image processors). Defaults to `$TMPDIR/sp/images`.
`imagehandler`::
   Assignments of screen type to external converters. For example, `imagehandler="mermaid:(/usr/bin/mmdc -i %%input%% -o %%output%%%.pdf)"`. The image type _mermaid_ is converted with the program `/usr/bin/mmdc` and receives as input parameter `-i`, the input file, `-o` and the output file with attached file extension `.pdf`. The file names are replaced at runtime and generated randomly. Multiple entries are separated by semicolons.
`ignore-case`::
   Ignore case when accessing files (on a case-insensitive file system).
`inkscape`::
   The path to the program inkscape when you need on the fly SVG to PDF conversion.
`inkscape-command`::
  Command line for image conversion. Version 0.92 and before needs `--export-pdf` and since version 1 it is `--export-filename`.
`jobname`::
   Name of the output file. Default is `publisher`.
`layout`::
   Name of the layout rule set (XML). The default name is `layout.xml`.
`luatex`::
   Path to the Lua(jit)TeX binary. Experimental! This is provided for your experiments, not for production use.
`mode`::
   Set the layout mode. See <<ch-advanced-cotrollayout>>.
`opencommand`::
   Command that will be run to open the documentation and the PDF file. For MacOS X this should be `open`, for Linux `xdg-open` or `exo-open` (xfce).
`pathrewrite`::
   Comma separated list of entries of the form A=B which replace parts in `file:///media/XYZ` to `file:///path/to/project/myfiles/XYZ`. Useful when you have absolute paths in the data which must be changed during the publishing process.
`pdfversion`::
  The PDF version that gets written. For example `1.7`.
`prependxml`::
   Add this XML file in front of the layout instructions. List of comma separated file names (`prependxml=file1.xml,file2.xml`).
`reportmissingglyphs`::
   Should requested but missing glyphs be reported as an error or as a warning? The allowed values are `true`, `false`, or `warning`. `false` disables the reporting.
`runs`::
   Set the number of runs.
`startpage`::
   Number of the first page.
`systemfonts`::
   If set to `true`, then the publisher searches for fonts in the system directory.
`tempdir`::
   Name of the temporary directory. Default is the system's temp.
`timeout`::
   Maximum time of the publishing run. If time is exceeded, the publisher exits with status 1.
`vars`::
   Comma separated list of variables and values in the form var=value to set additional variables.
`wd`::
   Set the current directory.
`xmlparser`::
  Sets the XML parser to use. Since version 4.5 the default is `go`, the old variant is `lua`. This option will be dropped in a future version of the Publisher in favor of the `go` variant and is currently included only for compatibility.



=== Section server (`server`)

`address`::
  IP address to which the server should open the port. Default is 127.0.0.1.
`extra-dir`::
  Extra directories for the publishing runs to be includes.
`filter`::
  Lua script to run before processing the publishing runs (like a call to `sp --filter ...`).
`logfile`::
  File name for the log. `STDOUT` for standard output and `STDERR` for standard error.
`port`::
  Port to which a connection can be established.
`runs`::
  Set the number of publishing runs for the client document.

=== Section Hotfolder (`hotfolder`)

``hotfolder``::
  Directory to be “watched”.
`events`::
  Rules which programs to run on which files.

A detailed description can be found in the <<ch-hotfolder>> section.


== Command line parameters
The valid command line parameters are written on a <<ch-commandline,separate page>>.

== Options given in the layout file
The XML layout file has a command called <<cmd-options,`<Options>`>> that allows to set some parameters (tracing, default language, …)
