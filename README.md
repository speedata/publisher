About
-----

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yzUJlVv.png"></p>


The speedata Publisher is a full featured database publishing software. It generates PDF files from XML data and XML layout instructions. It is used to make product catalogs and other documents with high demands on the layout.

Its built-in layout description language allows you to create almost arbitrary layouts, while keeping the job as simple as possible.

Examples
--------

There are some examples in the [example repository on github](https://github.com/speedata/examples) and [in the manual](https://speedata.github.io/publisher/manual/examples-en/index.html), these might get merged into that repository.


Can I use this in production?
